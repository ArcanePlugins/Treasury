     *         EconomySubscriber.asFuture(subscriber -> economy.retrievePlayerAccount(target, subscriber))

     *             .thenCompose(account -> EconomySubscriber.asFuture(subscriber -> account.setBalance(balance, currency, subscriber)))
     *             // And then we can use the final value however we like.
     *             .whenComplete((newBalance, exception) -> {
