## bStats Metrics

> Treasury utilizes bStats metrics, as do thousands of other Minecraft
plugins. This service collects very basic data on the server which is 
all public, e.g., how many servers are running Treasury, how many players are online, and so on. 
None of this data can be pinpointed back to a individual server, they all contribute to a single 
pool of data. All of the collected data is available at: <https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Treasury/12927>
>
> Metrics are used to guide development in the direction which will benefit most users.
> 
> To change whether bStats metrics should run on your server, simply visit the 
`/plugins/bStats/config.yml` 
file and 
edit it to your preference.
