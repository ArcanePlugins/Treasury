## Synopsis

Treasury is a *library* plugin which provides other plugins on your server a standardised way of 
communicating with each other through Treasury's *API* suite. It aims to be a modern spin on 
[Vault][Vault], offering concurrency support, multi-platform support, and
[a variety of other bonuses][API Comparison].

> For example, you may have a virtual economy set up on your server where players can buy and sell 
goods. Using Treasury's Economy API, your Shops plugin can make transactions in the economy to 
whichever economy '*provider*' plugin you have installed without them directly speaking to each 
other. This avoids plugins having to create an integration for every single other plugin they 
wish to support. 

Treasury is best known for its *Economy* API, but it also provides APIs for *Events*, *Services*,
and more to come. All of Treasury's APIs work on multiple platforms, from *Bukkit* to 
*Velocity* and even *Minestom*. Treasury's APIs take strong inspiration from existing ones and aim
to offer the best experience to share without any platform dependence.

We aim to keep Treasury stable, robust, lightweight, powerful, and supported. To achieve
this, Treasury maintainers conduct deep reviews into any changes to the plugin, especially
additions to the APIs so that we can guarantee their stability for the future. Free support is 
provided on our community [Discord][Discord] where maintainers, helpers, and other users discuss.

> Treasury utilizes bStats metrics, as do thousands of other Minecraft plugins and software, 
> from PaperMC to EssentialsX. This service collects very basic data on the server which is all 
> public, e.g., how many servers are running Treasury, how many players are online, and so on. 
> None of this data can be pinpointed back to a individual server, they all contribute to a 
> single pool of data. This basic data is extremely valuable for the project's maintainers to ensure
> the needs of Treasury's userbase are best catered for.
>
> All of the collected data is available [here][bStats Metrics].
> 
> Should you wish to opt-out of bStats, simply disable it in the bStats `config.yml` file.
