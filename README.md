## 📜 What is Treasury?

Treasury is a upcoming resource containing a modern API to facilitate virtual money
transactions on Minecraft servers between Economy providers (aka. Economy plugins) and plugins
that wish to use them (e.g. JobsReborn, ShopGUIPlus).

Like Vault, Treasury is installed as a plugin on a server. The plugin only offers an information
command and update checker. Treasury is used by economy provider plugins through Bukkit's
Service Manager.

## ❓ Why Treasury? Why not Vault?

I've tried my best to explain my intentions behind Treasury in [Treasury's feedback thread on the SpigotMC Forums](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/new-economy-api-looking-for-your-feedback.527805/).

The original post is all you need to see regarding this. 🙂
